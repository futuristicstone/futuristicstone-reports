# Cybersecurity Reports Portfolio

This repository contains two comprehensive cybersecurity reports that showcase my skills in both **Penetration Testing** and **Digital Forensics**. These reports demonstrate my abilities to conduct security assessments, analyze vulnerabilities, and respond to cybersecurity incidents.

## Contents

### 1. Penetration Test Report
This report demonstrates my skills in performing penetration testing on a target network/system. It includes detailed findings, methodologies, and recommendations for improving security posture.

#### Key Highlights:
- **Tools Used:** Nmap, OSINT, Nessus, RCE, Metasploit, Burp Suite
- **Scope:** External penetration testing, web application vulnerabilities, network scanning
- **Findings:** Critical vulnerabilities, exploitation techniques, and security recommendations

#### Feedback and Recognition from Teaching Assistant
> "Your report truly stands out among the past 2 cohorts due to the impressive technical depth you've showcased. The documentation is excellent, and the inclusion of an executive summary, detailed findings and evidence, risk assessments, and actionable recommendations makes it incredibly thorough."

> "One of the most valuable aspects of your report is the way you've managed to clearly and understandably explain complex technical details and connect them to strategic decision-making. This makes your report not only useful for technical stakeholders but also accessible and impactful for non-technical audiences. Your ability to effectively bridge this gap is a testament to your strong communication skills and deep understanding of the subject matter."

### 2. Digital Forensics Report
This report illustrates my expertise in conducting digital forensics investigations. It focuses on the analysis of digital evidence from a suspected security breach and includes detailed steps for data acquisition, analysis, and evidence preservation.

#### Key Highlights:
- **Tools Used:** Kali Linux Terminal, Sleuth Kit Autopsy Forensic Application, SQlite Browser, MD5 and SHA-256 hashes to ensure the integrity of the evidence, Evidence Tagging ( +CAT-6 Items of Interest)
- **Scope:** On January 21, 2016, Digitech Inc. was called in to assist Pure Gold Credit Union (PGCU)) case involving the conspiracy associated with the theft of funds. As part of the investigation, Peterâ€™s (primary suspect) iPhone was taken into custody. Digitech, Inc. was tasked with investigating evidence relevant to the aforementioned conspiracy. Through my research I found evidence strongly suggesting a conspiracy between PGCU employees to fraudulently withdraw funds. Upon further investigation, I identify Peter Barnes, Rosie Lloyd and alias Hockeyfan474 as conspirators. 
- **Findings:** Detailed chain of custody, forensic analysis steps, and incident resolution
